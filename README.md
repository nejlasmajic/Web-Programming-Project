MyRecipes Application 

People who love cooking, and exploring some new recipes could use an application for storing the favoruite ones. 

Intuitive UI of application needs to provide possibility to save new, and search existing recipes, or filter them from database. Each recipe could have information such as name, category (meal, drink, dessert), author, photo, rate, time for preparing, quantity and perhaps some additional notes. 

Login panel should exist, because this application will be personal. To extend the project, there is a possiblity that some additional roles will be added, such as Friend - people who could log in to see recepies, but would not be able to edit any information about the recepies, but there should be a possibility they could leave some comment for recepies. 
Furthermore, there could be a possibility to recalculate amount of ingredients based for how many persons meal will be made.

Some of the features might be added during the work on the application.
